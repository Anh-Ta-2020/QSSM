# QSSM
This is the code repository for numerical simulation experiments with QSSM - a state space model inspired quantum model for sequential modeling. It contains 2 folders. 

1. The 'Cosine dataset' folder contains notebooks for QSSM and a reference RNN model trained on a synthetic dataset generated by cosine function, as well as two checkpoints of pretrained models. 
2.  The 'Linbladian dataset' folder contains notebooks and checkpoints of simulations on a dataset generated from a quantum process.
